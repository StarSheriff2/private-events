# Private-Events

This is a private events platform created with Ruby on Rails, where users can Create or Attend multiple events. Advanced Associations from ActiveRecord were used in this project.

# About

We created an Events Web-App based on the functionality of Eventbrite site. For this, we had to work with Active Record associations, validations, and session cookies for user authentication.

What you can do on the app:
- Create users and login with your user
- Access to the information of each event
- Create a registration for an event while you are logged in
- Create events as a registered user

In this project we:
- Created models, views, and controllers for users and events
- Made validations for the user inputs
- Created a controller and a model for the attendance of each event
- Worked with associations between users, events, and attendances
